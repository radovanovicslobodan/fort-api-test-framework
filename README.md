## API Testing Framework (Proof of Concept)
A Proof of Concept (PoC) API test automation framework built using REST Assured and Cucumber-JVM in Java. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, maintainable, and readable API testing solution for real-world applications â€” specifically targeting integration with an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system .

# Purpose
This project aims to:

- Demonstrate best practices in building a BDD-driven API test framework .
- Provide a scalable structure that can be extended for enterprise-level EHR systems.
- Showcase integration with a real-world healthcare API (simulated or mocked).
- Promote reusability, reporting, and clean code organization.
